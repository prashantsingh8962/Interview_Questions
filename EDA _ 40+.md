## **III. Descriptive Statistics**

### **11. What are the measures of central tendency?**
**Answer:**  
The measures of central tendency include:
- Mean: The average value
- Median: The middle value when data is ordered
- Mode: The most frequent value

### **12. What is the difference between mean and median?**
**Answer:**  
The mean is the average of all data points, while the median is the middle value when the data is sorted. The median is less affected by outliers and skewed data than the mean.

### **13. What are the measures of dispersion?**
**Answer:**  
The measures of dispersion include:
- Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values
- Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean
- Standard Deviation: The square root of variance
- Interquartile Range (IQR): The range of the middle 50% of the data

### **14. How do you interpret a high standard deviation?**
**Answer:**  
A high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values, meaning there is more variability in the data.

### **15. What is skewness, and how does it affect data analysis?**
**Answer:**  
Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution. A positive skew means a longer tail on the right, while a negative skew indicates a longer tail on the left. Skewness can affect the mean, leading to incorrect inferences if not addressed.

### **16. What is kurtosis?**
**Answer:**  
Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the data distribution. High kurtosis indicates heavy tails (outliers), while low kurtosis indicates light tails. It's useful for understanding the extremity of outliers.

### **29. What is the Z-score, and how is it used to detect outliers?**
**Answer:**  
The Z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. A high absolute Z-score (typically above 3) indicates a potential outlier.

### **30. What is the IQR, and how is it used to detect outliers?**
**Answer:**  
The Interquartile Range (IQR) is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles. Outliers are typically identified as points that lie below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR.

### **31. How do you handle outliers once they are detected?**
**Answer:**  
Outliers can be handled by:
- Removing them if they are erroneous or irrelevant
- Transforming them using logarithmic or square root transformations

## **VII. Correlation and Causality**

### **32. What is the difference between correlation and causality?**
**Answer:**  
Correlation indicates a relationship between two variables, where changes in one variable are associated with changes in another. Causality implies that one variable directly affects the other. Correlation does not imply causation.

### **33. How do you test for correlation between two variables?**
**Answer:**  
Correlation

 between two variables can be tested using:
- Pearson correlation coefficient (for linear relationships between continuous variables)
- Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (for monotonic relationships or ordinal variables)
- Kendall’s tau (for ordinal data or small sample sizes)

### **34. What is multicollinearity, and how does it affect EDA?**
**Answer:**  
Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables in a model are highly correlated, leading to instability in coefficient estimates and difficulty in determining the effect of each variable. It can be detected using variance inflation factor (VIF) and addressed by removing or combining correlated variables.

### **35. How do you deal with multicollinearity?**
**Answer:**  
Multicollinearity can be dealt with by:
- Removing one of the correlated variables
- Combining correlated variables into a single feature
- Using regularization techniques like Ridge regression

## **VIII. Advanced EDA Techniques**

### **36. What is a time series analysis, and how is it relevant in EDA?**
**Answer:**  
Time series analysis involves studying data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. In EDA, it helps in understanding trends, seasonal patterns, and cyclical behaviors over time.

### **37. What is dimensionality reduction, and why is it important in EDA?**
**Answer:**  
Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of input variables in a dataset. It’s important because it simplifies the model, reduces computation time, and helps in visualizing high-dimensional data.

### **38. What is the curse of dimensionality?**
**Answer:**  
The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces. As the number of dimensions increases, the volume of the space increases exponentially, making the data sparse and the analysis difficult.

### **39. What is a t-SNE, and how is it used in EDA?**
**Answer:**  
t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a dimensionality reduction technique particularly well-suited for visualizing high-dimensional datasets. It helps in creating a 2D or 3D map of the data while preserving the relative distances between points.

### **40. What is clustering, and how is it used in EDA?**
**Answer:**  
Clustering is the process of grouping data points into clusters based on similarity. In EDA, clustering helps in identifying natural groupings within the data, detecting patterns, and discovering subgroups in the dataset.

## **IX. Real-World Scenarios and Case Studies**

### **41. How would you perform EDA on a dataset with both numerical and categorical variables?**
**Answer:**  
For numerical variables, you would use summary statistics, histograms, and box plots. For categorical variables, you would use bar charts, frequency tables, and cross-tabulations. Interaction between the two types can be explored using groupby functions, pivot tables, and visualizations like stacked bar charts or violin plots.

### **42. Suppose you have a dataset with 90% of the data missing in a particular column. What would you do?**
**Answer:**  
If a column has 90% missing data, it’s often better to drop that column unless the missing data itself carries information. Alternatively, you could try imputation methods, but they may not be reliable with such a high percentage of missing values.

### **43. How would you handle a dataset with highly imbalanced classes?**
**Answer:**  
For imbalanced classes, you could use techniques like:
- Resampling: Over-sampling the minority class or under-sampling the majority class
- Using algorithms that are robust to imbalanced data (e.g., decision trees, ensemble methods)
- Applying class weights in models
- Generating synthetic samples using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

### **44. How do you perform EDA on a large dataset that doesn’t fit into memory?**
**Answer:**  
For large datasets, you can:
- Use sampling techniques to work with a representative subset of the data
- Use chunk processing in libraries like Pandas
- Employ distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark or Dask

### **45. Describe how you would identify and address a data leakage problem during EDA?**
**Answer:**  
Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates. To identify leakage, ensure that no future data is used to predict the past and that data transformations are applied consistently across training and test datasets. Address leakage by reviewing feature engineering and ensuring proper data splits.
