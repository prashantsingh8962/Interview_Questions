### **Advanced DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) Questions:**

93. **How do you calculate a running total in Power BI using DAX?**
   - **Answer:** You can calculate a running total in Power BI using the `CALCULATE` and `FILTER` functions combined with `SUM`. For example:
     ```DAX
     RunningTotal = 
     CALCULATE(
         SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]),
         FILTER(
             ALLSELECTED(Sales[Date]),
             Sales[Date] <= MAX(Sales[Date])
         )
     )
     ```
     This formula sums the `SalesAmount` for all dates up to and including the current date.

94. **What is the difference between `ALL` and `ALLEXCEPT` in DAX?**
   - **Answer:** 
     - **ALL:** Removes all filters from the specified columns or tables, effectively calculating the measure in a context-free environment.
     - **ALLEXCEPT:** Removes all filters from a table except the ones explicitly mentioned, allowing you to keep certain filters intact while removing others.

95. **How can you use DAX to calculate the Year-over-Year (YoY) growth?**
   - **Answer:** To calculate YoY growth, you can use the `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR` function. For example:
     ```DAX
     YoY_Growth = 
     DIVIDE(
         SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]) - CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Calendar[Date])),
         CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Calendar[Date])),
         0
     )
     ```
     This calculates the difference between the current year’s sales and the previous year’s sales, then divides by the previous year’s sales to find the percentage change.
